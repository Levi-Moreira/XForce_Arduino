# xForce

This github repository contains the firmware version for both the Light and Door Modules of xForce.



### Getting started:

Getting started with the modules is fairly simple, 
* Open the Documentation.pdf to learn how to implement the circuits used to control the lights and doors.
* Once you've implemented the circuits, load the .ino file to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
* Test and enjoy yourself.
